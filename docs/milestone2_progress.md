# Milestone 2 Progress Report

## Tasks breakdown:

Forward mode implementation: Anjali, Ling, Hazel
* AD class constructor properly defined
  * Elementary functions defined
  * Right side versions also defined as needed
  * Add, mult, subtract, truediv, negation,  - Anjali
  * Exponential, sin, cos, tan, arcsin, arccos, arctan, cross product - Ling
  * init, log, sqrt, power, self.getvalue, self.getderivative - Hazel
  * make_variable - at the end, Anjali/Ling/Hazel

* Test suite implementation: Geoff
  * Implement tests for the AD Forward Mode
  * Create testing boilerplate
  * Add automatic codecov scoring and testing
  * Documentation on how to run tests

* Documentation: Hazel, Anjali, Ling
  * will update how-to-use, software organization, and implementation details
  * How do we install package
  * Add requirements.txt (python version, Numpy version, etc)
  * Advanced features we are going to implement after Milestone 2
    * Vector inputs of vector functions
    * Reverse Mode AD 

We decided to divide Milestone 2 into 3 parts, forward mode implementation, test suite implementation and the documentation. Anjali, Ling and Hazel will work on the forward mode implementation, where Anjali and Ling will take lead. Geoff will work on the test suite implementation. Finally, all four of us will work on the documentation, where Hazel will take lead.

Since the submission of Milestone 1, weâ€™ve had several meetings to figure out the implementation details. Anjali and Hazel have also gone to office hours to discuss our plan from Milestone 1. Ling and Geoff have begun working on the forward implementation and begun to think about how to implement the test suite. Each of us did the HW4 where we implemented the ToyAD class which was good practice for this assignment.
